# Try Out Development Containers: Python

This is a sample project to go along with the "try" quick start for the **[VS Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)** extension.

**If you aren't already following the quick start, [see here](#setting-up-the-development-container).**

## Things to try

One you have this sample opened in a container, you'll be able to work with it like you would locally. 

Some things to try:

1. **Edit:**
   1. Open `server.py`
   2. Try adding some code and check out the language features.
2. **Terminal:** Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> and type `uname` and or other Linux commands from the terminal window.
2. **Build, Run, and Debug:**
   1. Open `sever.py`
   2. Add a breakpoint.
   3. Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   4. Open a local browser and go to `http://localhost:9000` and note you can connect to the server in the container.
   5. Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables, examining locals, and more.
3. **Forward another port:**
   1. Stop debugging
   2. Open `sever.py`
   3. Change the server port to 5000. (`PORT = 5000`)
   4. Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   5. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run the **Remote-Containers: Forward Port...** command.
   6. Select port 5000.
   7. Click "Open Browser" in the notification that appears to access the web app on this new port.
